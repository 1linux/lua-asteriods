lua-asteroids is an Asteroids game made with LÖVE.

LÖVE is an *awesome* framework you can use to make 2D games in Lua. It's free, open-source, and works on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.

Documentation
-------------

Sorry no docs yet

Repository
----------

I use the 'main' branch for development of the current release, but it should be considered reasonably stable.

Builds
------

Not yet. However LÖVE apps are just Lua scrips, and therefore need no build. Just doubleclick asteroids.bat on Windows.

Contributing
------------

The project is pretty much an experiment at the current time. Feel free to cantact me if you´d like to participate.

Dependencies
------------

- LÖVE runtime [https://github.com/love2d/love/releases]

Motivation
---
I (Helmut Gruber) spent a resonable amount of time (and money) to play asteroids far back in those times, when arcade slot machines where widespread. I still like it, and today´s computer power can boost this appealing game type to a new level. Additionally, I am adicted to coding in Lua.
